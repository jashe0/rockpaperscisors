This was an interesting project to work on. It  brough together quite a lot of things I have learned recently about javascript including about functions,arrays, if statements among others. I had to look up how to prompt for a users input and a few other things along the way too.

revisiting this project to add a gui taught me about events, DOM manipulation and was a good chance to go back over old code to try to improve it in general.
